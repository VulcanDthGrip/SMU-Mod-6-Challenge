The purpose of this challenge was to create a 5-day Weather Website. The user would tyoe the name of the location and the API will make a GET request to retrieve the current weather and 5-day forecast for the requested location. The only input was the location search field. Additionally, the applciaiton would store and create a running list of the previous searches. There is also a 'Clear History' button the user can click to clear out local storage.

### Acceptance Criteria 

1. When you search for a city, you receive the current and future weather forecast
2. When the location is retrieved, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and a graphical representation of the current weather.
3. When the location is retrieved, the 5-day forecast also includes the information referenced in 2.
4. When I click on one the previous locations stored, the weather for the selected location is retrieved and displated.
5. When I click on the 'Clear History' button, all previous searches collected are erased.

The build was compartmentalized into several categories:
1. Html
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. JSON
